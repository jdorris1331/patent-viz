        | 1. A Stirling cooler comprising: a case; a cylinder fixedly installed in the case, and provided with a piston such that the piston can reciprocate therein; a displacer installed in the piston such that the displacer can reciprocate therein; a regenerator connected to the displacer in a line in an axial direction of the cylinder; an outer stator fixed between the case and the cylinder; an inner stator inserted into an outer surface of the cylinder; a magnet positioned between the outer stator and the inner stator to reciprocate the piston; and a fixing device that fixes the inner stator to the cylinder, wherein the fixing device includes: a first stopper detachably attached to the cylinder such that the first stopper contacts a rear surface of the inner stator; and a second stopper formed integrally with the cylinder such that the second stopper contacts a front surface of the inner stator, said second stopper having a protrusion outwardly protruding from the cylinder and inserted into a groove formed at the front surface of the inner stator, wherein a screw is formed at a side surface of the protrusion.
